This is a colaborated group project done with [@chathucka](https://github.com/chathucka) and other two members.

Introduction
>Our project was designed to analyze a program statement and determine its complexity. The size is determined to measure the complexity of the program statement. The complexity due to methods and size were to be determined by this project. And to measure the complexity of the program statement due to variables, only the declared of defined variables were used. Furthermore, the complexity of the program statement due to coupling should also be calculated. And another important section is inheritance, which is the process of deriving a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods. And also, the complexity of a program statement due to control structures is also determined in this project.
To calculate the size the main factors, that should be considered were keywords, identifiers, operators, numeric values, and string literals. And to determine the methods, the primitive and composite data type parameters and return type of methods should be identified. And for the calculation of complexity due to variables, the number of primitive and composite data type parameters should be identified.
In determining the complexity of the program statement due to coupling, functions have to be created to identify the number of recursive calls, couplings which are not occurring in built-in functions. And the methods calling another regular or recursive methods, recursive methods calling other methods should be identified.
For the determination of the complexity due to inheritance, number of inherited user-defined classes should be identified. Details such as the keywords, identifiers, operators, numerical values, string literals, number of primitive and composite data types, number of global and local variables, inherited patterns and the number of conditions in the control structure should be identified.
Furthermore, we needed to determine the complexity of a program statement due to control structures. The mainly used control structure are while loops, do-while loops, exception handling, break and continue statements and if else statements. To calculate the complexity of a program statement due to control structures the number of conditions in the control structure is needed.

Users can typically upload a file or copy paste a sample code to the text area of the uploading page and then continue to scan the code.

When scanning is complete analyzed data will be shown in tables as information to users with program statements.
